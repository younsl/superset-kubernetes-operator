# Getting Started

This guide walks through installing the operator and deploying a minimal
Superset instance using dev mode.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes v1.28+ cluster
- Helm 3
- A PostgreSQL database accessible from the cluster

## 1. Install the operator

```bash
helm install superset-operator \
  oci://ghcr.io/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/charts/superset-operator \
  --version <version> \
  --namespace superset-operator-system \
  --create-namespace
```

Replace `<version>` with a published chart version (e.g., `0.1.0`); see
[Downloads](reference/downloads.md) for published tags.

## 2. Deploy Superset

Create a minimal Superset instance in dev mode (inline credentials for simplicity):

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<'EOF'
apiVersion: superset.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: Superset
metadata:
  name: my-superset
spec:
  environment: Development
  image:
    tag: "6.1.0"
  secretKey: thisIsNotSecure_changeInProduction!
  metastore:
    uri: postgresql+psycopg2://superset:superset@postgres:5432/superset
  webServer: {}
  lifecycle:
    migrate: {}
    init:
      adminUser: {}
      loadExamples: true
EOF
```

The operator runs database migrations and initialization, then deploys the web server.

## 3. Watch it come up

```bash
kubectl get superset my-superset -w
```

Wait for `PHASE: Running`. You can also inspect lifecycle task state on the
parent:

```bash
kubectl describe superset my-superset
```

## 4. Access Superset

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/my-superset-web-server 8088:8088
```

Open [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088) and log in with `admin` / `admin`.
