# Apache Superset Kubernetes Operator

!!! warning "Under Development"
    This project is under active development and is not yet stable. APIs, CRD schemas, and behavior may change without notice between releases. Do not use in production.

A Kubernetes operator for deploying and managing [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/). Built with the Go-based [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/).

The operator manages the full Superset lifecycle: database migrations, configuration rendering, component deployment, scaling, and networking. Users define a single `Superset` custom resource, and the operator resolves it into per-component child CRDs that each manage their own Deployment, ConfigMap, and Service.

## Features

- **Sane defaults** — production-ready settings out of the box that adapt automatically to your workload
- **Painless management** — structured configuration fields with per-component config generated automatically
- **Full control** — every default is overridable, from high-level presets down to individual fields, with a raw Python escape hatch for anything not covered
- **Flat configuration** — shared top-level defaults inherited by all components, with per-component overrides (primitives replace, collections merge)
- **Component toggle** — enable CeleryWorker, CeleryBeat, CeleryFlower, WebsocketServer, or McpServer by setting their spec; omit to disable
- **Init lifecycle** — database migration and initialization run as managed Pods before components deploy
- **Checksum-driven rollouts** — config changes automatically trigger rolling restarts of affected components
- **Networking** — Gateway API (HTTPRoute) and Ingress support
- **HPA with custom metrics**, PodDisruptionBudgets, NetworkPolicies, Prometheus ServiceMonitor

## What it looks like

A typical Superset deployment for getting started in dev mode:

```yaml
apiVersion: superset.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: Superset
metadata:
  name: my-superset
spec:
  image:
    tag: "latest"
  environment: dev
  secretKey: thisIsNotSecure_changeInProduction!
  metastore:
    host: postgres
    port: 5432
    database: superset
    username: superset
    password: superset
  config: |
    FEATURE_FLAGS = {"ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING": True}
  webServer:
    replicas: 2
  mcpServer: {}
  init:
    adminUser: {}
    loadExamples: true
```

For production, use `secretKeyFrom` and `metastore.uriFrom` to reference Kubernetes Secrets instead of inline values:

```yaml
apiVersion: superset.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: Superset
metadata:
  name: my-superset
spec:
  image:
    tag: "6.0.1"
  secretKeyFrom:
    name: superset-secret
    key: secret-key
  metastore:
    uriFrom:
      name: db-credentials
      key: connection-string
  config: |
    FEATURE_FLAGS = {"ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING": True}
  webServer:
    replicas: 2
  mcpServer: {}
```

The operator resolves this into child CRDs and their underlying resources. The init child CR runs database migrations before components deploy:

```
$ kubectl get supersets
NAME           PHASE     VERSION   AGE
my-superset    Running   latest     5m

$ kubectl get supersettasks
NAME                     PHASE      ATTEMPTS   AGE
my-superset-migrate      Complete   1          5m
my-superset-init         Complete   1          5m

$ kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=superset
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    AGE
my-superset-web-server-6d4b8c7f9-k2x8m        1/1     Running   4m
my-superset-web-server-6d4b8c7f9-p9f3n        1/1     Running   4m
my-superset-mcp-server-5c6d7e8f9-x9y1z        1/1     Running   4m
```
