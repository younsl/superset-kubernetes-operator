# Releases

This page tracks notable changes in Apache Superset Kubernetes Operator
releases.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial release.

### Known limitations

- **Websocket server is experimental.** The websocket server is not yet well
  supported and is pending security hardening; it is not recommended for
  production use.
- **Downgrade protection requires semver image tags.** Downgrades are detected
  and blocked only when both image tags are valid semver. Non-semver tags
  (`latest`, date stamps, digest pins) cannot be ordered, so the operator emits a
  `VersionComparisonSkipped` warning and proceeds without blocking. See
  [Lifecycle](../user-guide/lifecycle.md).
- **Task failure messages may include credential fragments.** Lifecycle task
  failure output is truncated into `status` and could contain fragments of task
  stdout, including credentials. See [security.md](security.md).
