# Releases

This page tracks notable changes in Apache Superset Kubernetes Operator
releases.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- **Breaking:** downgrade blocking is removed. Any change to the lifecycle image
  tag now re-runs the migrate task (`superset db upgrade`) regardless of
  direction — the operator no longer performs semver comparison or sets
  `status.phase: Blocked` on a version decrease, matching the official Superset
  Helm chart. The migrate task only runs `superset db upgrade` (Superset's down
  migrations are poorly tested and often break, so the operator never runs
  them), so take a database backup before an upgrade if you may need to revert.
  The `direction` field is removed from `status.lifecycle.upgrade`, and the
  `VersionComparisonSkipped` warning event no longer fires.
- **Breaking:** the lifecycle `clone` task is renamed to `seed`. Rename
  `spec.lifecycle.clone` to `spec.lifecycle.seed` (and its `postCloneSQL` field
  to `postSeedSQL`) in your Superset resources. The task Job name suffix changes
  from `-clone` to `-seed`, and the lifecycle status phase from `Cloning` to
  `Seeding`. Custom `seed.command` scripts must read the renamed
  `SUPERSET_OPERATOR__SEED_SRC_*` environment variables.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- Honor HPA-managed replica counts: the operator no longer overwrites the
  replica count on Deployments whose scaling is owned by a
  HorizontalPodAutoscaler ([#152](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/152), [@pashtet04](https://github.com/pashtet04)).

## 0.1.0 - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Initial release ([@villebro](https://github.com/villebro)).

### Known limitations

- **Websocket server is experimental.** The websocket server is not yet well
  supported and is pending security hardening; it is not recommended for
  production use.
- **Downgrade protection requires semver image tags.** Downgrades are detected
  and blocked only when both image tags are valid semver. Non-semver tags
  (`latest`, date stamps, digest pins) cannot be ordered, so the operator emits a
  `VersionComparisonSkipped` warning and proceeds without blocking. See
  [Lifecycle](../user-guide/lifecycle.md).
- **Task failure messages may include credential fragments.** Lifecycle task
  failure output is truncated into `status` and could contain fragments of task
  stdout, including credentials. See [security.md](security.md).
