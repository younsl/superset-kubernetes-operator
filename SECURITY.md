# Security Policy

## Security Model

The operator defaults to `Production` mode. CRD validation rejects inline
secrets and credentials must be referenced from Kubernetes Secrets via
`secretKeyFrom`, `metastore.uriFrom`, `metastore.passwordFrom`,
`valkey.passwordFrom`, or websocket `configFrom`. The operator never reads,
logs, or stores secret values in ConfigMaps or CRD status fields. The operator
runs as a non-root, distroless container with read-only root filesystem,
dropped capabilities, and least-privilege RBAC. `Staging` keeps production
secret handling while allowing destructive clone workflows for migration tests.

**Lifecycle task caveat:** When a lifecycle task Job fails, a truncated failure
message (max 256 characters) may appear in the parent Superset status and Events. If the task
command's error output includes credentials, a fragment could be exposed. This
only applies to the task container's own output, not to operator-managed secret
references.

Users who can create or modify `Superset` custom resources are trusted — they can
deploy arbitrary containers and Python configuration. Restrict access to Superset
CRs using Kubernetes RBAC.

For a detailed description of trust boundaries, security assumptions, and
scope, see the [Security](docs/reference/security.md) documentation. If you are unsure
whether something crosses the operator's trust boundary, please report it
privately and the maintainers will help triage it.

## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Apache Superset Kubernetes Operator project follows the
[Apache Software Foundation vulnerability handling process](https://apache.org/security/).

To report a security vulnerability, please email **security@apache.org**.

Please do **not** file a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

## Scope

This policy covers the Superset Kubernetes Operator and its components:

- CRD definitions and CEL validation rules
- Controller reconciliation logic
- RBAC and resource management
- Helm chart and deployment manifests
